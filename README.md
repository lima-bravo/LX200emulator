# LX200emulator
This python utility emulates an LX200GPS connected to a SkiFi device. It is intended to help speed development of LX200 apps for iOS and Android.

This utility is very incomplete and will extend over time, as more features are needed.

Usage:  python lx200emulator.py <port>

The default port is 4030.
